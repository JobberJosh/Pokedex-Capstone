# Pokedex-Capstone
This is a Pokedex displaying all of the Pokemon from the first generation of the series! I'm a huge fan of the series, and I thought this website may intrigue any video game fans like myself. I went for a more simple and sleek approach. I just used PokeAPI to pull the Pokemon name, type, and a picture. I didn't feel the need to dive deeper with moves, stats, etc. as I assumed most wouldn't know what they are or their purpose anyway. If this gets good feeback though, I may update the site as time goes on and add the ability to click on each Pokemon which could pull up a stat sheet showing different information about each Pokemon. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy Poke Nostalgia!

The features I used in this website include:
1.) Pulled data from PokeAPI to display all of the information you see on the page.
2.) Use of arrays to store and retrieve information that is displayed on my page.
3.) 

No special requirements are required to run my site! Just clone the repository and enjoy!
